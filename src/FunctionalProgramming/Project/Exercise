Integrative Exercise: Lambdas + Streams

A car dealership wants to create an application to manage the cars they have for sale.
For that, they need the following data from each car: model, brand, and cost.

Currently, the dealership has the following price list:

Brand	Model	Price
Volkswagen	Amarok	25000
Volkswagen	Taos	32000
Chevrolet	Onix	22000
Chevrolet	Tracker	30000
Fiat	Cronos	21000
Fiat	Pulse	24000
Toyota	Corolla	28000
Toyota	Yaris	23000
Renault	Stepway	20000
Renault	Duster	27000
Nissan	Versa	25000
Based on this data, ensure the program can:

Sort the list of vehicles by price in ascending order and print the result on screen.
Sort simultaneously by brand and price (both criteria) and print the result.
Extract a list of all vehicles whose price does not exceed 23000.
Filter only the vehicles from the Chevrolet and Volkswagen brands.
Show all cars whose model contains at least one letter “a”.
