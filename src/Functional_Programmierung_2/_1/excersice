Topic 1: Basic filtering (filter)

1-
**Evens and Multiples of 3**
Given the list of integers `List<Integer> nums = List.of(5, 12, 7, 18, 21, 30, 41, 60);`, use a stream to:

* Filter all even numbers and store them in a new list.
* Filter all numbers that are multiples of 3 and store them in a different list.

Then, print both lists to verify that the filtering worked correctly.

2-

**Filter names by length**
You have the list `List<String> nombres = List.of("Luis", "Ana", "Catalina", "John", "Bea", "Martín", "Alexandra");`.

* Filter only the names whose length is strictly greater than 4 characters.
* Then, filter only those which, **in addition to having length > 4**, also start with “A” or “M” (two chained filters).

Remember: when chaining filters, the second `filter(...)` only applies to the elements that passed the first one.
